# AI-Driven Data Quality & Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-driven approach to detecting data quality issues and anomalies in financial datasets. The system flags suspicious records and generates audit-friendly explanations to support risk and compliance teams.

## Why This Matters
In regulated industries like banking, incorrect data can lead to poor decisions and regulatory risk. This project focuses on data integrity rather than black-box predictions.

## Key Features
- Automated data quality checks
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Explainable, human-readable risk explanations
- Works with any numerical CSV dataset
- Visual insights for anomaly review

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab
